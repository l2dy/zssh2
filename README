			---------------------


zssh2 (Zmodem SSH 2) is a fork of zssh. It is a program  for  interactively
transferring  files to  a remote machine while using the secure shell (SSH).
It is intended to be a convenient alternative to scp , allowing to transfer
files without having to open another session and re-authenticate oneself.

Files  are transferred through  the zmodem  protocol, using  the rz  and sz
commands.   If you  don't  already have  them,  the sz/rz  programs can  be
installed from Uwe Ohse's lrzsz package, for more information, see
https://www.ohse.de/uwe/software/lrzsz.html

the readline library is also required.
